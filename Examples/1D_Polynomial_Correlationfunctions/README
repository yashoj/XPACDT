Basic examples to calculate classical and RPMD position-position 
autocorrelation functions for one-dimensional polynomial potentials
(e.g. harmonic and quartic osillators). This should reproduce the results
published in the first RPMD paper, JCP 121, 3368 (2004).

There are examples for different potentials, beta values and bead numbers.
All Input files are labeled with the potential (A, HO, Q), the beta value (1, 8)
and the number of beads (1, 4, 32). 

The potentials are named as follows.
A - anharmonic potential (0.5x^2 + 0.1x^3 + 0.01x^4)
HO - harmonic potential (0.5x^2)
Q - quartic potential (0.25x^4)

The examples can be run using the 'do_all.sh' shell script. For each case
a folder is generated with the same naming conventions as the input file.
The resulting correlation function is stored in the file 'commandCXX.dat' 
in the respective folder and can be plotted using 'gnuplot 'commandCXX.plt',
which will create an eps file named 'commandCXX.eps'.

Reference correlation functions are given in the folder 'reference'.

Please note that running each file can take about 2 hours. This depends upon
upon the number of samples requested which can be changed in the full input
files. Increasing the number of samples will lead to more accurate results.
