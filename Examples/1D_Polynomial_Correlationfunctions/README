Basic examples to calculate classical and RPMD position-position 
autocorrelation functions for one-dimensional polynomial potentials
(e.g. harmonic and quartic osillators). This should reproduce the results
published in the first RPMD paper, JCP 121, 3368 (2004).

There are examples for different potentials, beta values and bead numbers,
each in its own folder.

----- Top level -----
A - anharmonic potential (0.5x^2 + 0.1x^3 + 0.01x^4)
HO - harmonic potential (0.5x^2)
Q - quartic potential (0.25x^4)
----- Second level -----
Beta values of 1 and 8
----- Third level -----
Number of beads; 1 and 4 or 32, depending on beta.

Each example can be run using the 'doit.sh' shell script. This runs 
a sampling step first and then propagates each sample in real time. 
After that, the results are used to generate the correlation function 
stored in cxx.dat
