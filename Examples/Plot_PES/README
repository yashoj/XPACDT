This folder contrains a few examples on how to plot a potential energy
surface or cut through a potential energy surface using XPACDT.

The examples use simple one-dimensional potentials (1dPolynomial, Eckart)
or fitted triatomic potential energy surfaces for the H3 and FH2
systems, respectively (BKMP2, LWAL).
