Example on how to run Tully's fewest switches surface hopping (FSSH) for 
Tully model potentials.

This also serves as an integrated test for the surface hopping part of 
the code to reproduce the results from Tully's original FSSH paper, 
J. Chem. Phys. 93, 1061 (1990).

All three of the models (A, B and C) can be tested at once using the script
'launch_all.sh' which in turn runs 'run_tully_model.sh' with appropriate
command line arguments such as the model type, and initial momentum p (start, 
step and stop values). This will generate a folder 'results_model_#' where 
# can be A, B or C, and within it the corresponding results for all p in
files named 'all_p_*.dat' where * is the quantity of interest which are
reflection in state 0 (named 'state_0_refl_adiab'), 
reflection in state 1 ('state_1_refl_adiab'),
transmission in state 0 ('state_0_transm_adiab') and
transmission in state 1 ('state_1_transm_adiab').

Please note that each run with one p value can take about 30-45 mins,
so running one model can take several hours depending upon the step size.
The step size and selection of a particular model can all be changed in
'launch_all.sh'.

Finally once the result files are generated, they can be plotted using
'gnuplot plot_tully_model_results.plt' which outputs the plots onto eps files
with name 'result_tully_model_*.eps' where * can be A, B or C.
