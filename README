XPACDT is still in its earliest development phase. Its purpose is to treat 
polyatomic chemical dynamics problems by solving Newtons equations of motion 
directly or in an extended ring-polymer phase space. Non-Born-Oppenheimer 
effects are included employ different approaches, including fewest switches 
surface hopping.

Requirements:
	- Python 3.7.1
	- numpy XXX
	- scipy XXX
	- PyGIT
	- TODO: What else...

Installation:
	- Run the "install" script to generate important environment variables.
	- Follow the on-screen instructions for permanent setting of the environment variables.

Verifying the code:
	- To check if everything works correctly, unittests can be run. To do so, lease got to XPACDT/UnitTests and run "python allTests.py".

Help:
	- Consult the confluence page at: https://confluence.desy.de/display/CDT/XPACDT%3A+eXtended+PolyAtomic+Chemical+Dynamics+Toolkit
