XPACDT is still in its earliest development phase. Its purpose is to treat 
polyatomic chemical dynamics problems by solving Newtons equations of motion 
directly or in an extended ring-polymer phase space. Non-Born-Oppenheimer 
effects are included employ different approaches, including fewest switches 
surface hopping.

Requirements:
	- Python 3.7.1
	- numpy XXX
	- scipy XXX
	- PyGIT
	- TODO: What else...

Installation:
	- Run the "install" script to generate important environment variables.
	- Follow the on-screen instructions for permanent setting of the environment variables.
