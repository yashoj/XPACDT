XPACDT is still in its earliest development phase. Its purpose is to treat 
polyatomic chemical dynamics problems by solving Newtons equations of motion 
directly or in an extended ring-polymer phase space. Non-Born-Oppenheimer 
effects are included employ different approaches, including fewest switches 
surface hopping.

Requirements: see requirements.txt

Installation:
	- Run the "install" script to generate important environment variables.
	- Follow the on-screen instructions for permanent setting of the environment variables.

Verifying the code:
	- To check if everything works correctly, unittests can be run. To do so, lease got to XPACDT/UnitTests and run "python allTests.py".

Examples:
	- Basic examples will be made available in the 'Examples' folder.

Generate Documentation:
	 - To generate the general documentation please execute the following commands: 
	    cd docs 
	    make html 
	 - The documentation can then be accessed using a standard browser to open 'docs/build/html/index.html' 
	 - Documentation can also be build in other formats. Please run 'make' in the docs folder to learn more.
