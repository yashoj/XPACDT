Module to plot potential energy surfaces. The module can plot one- and two-dimensional cuts through the potential energy surface. Additional degrees of freedom can be set to a fixed value or optimized (i.e., set to the value that minimizes the energy). The potential energy is calculated on a regular one- or two-dimensional grid specified in the input and the resulting values are written to a file. Additionally, a gnuplot file is created that can be used (and modified) to perform the actual plot.

Please note that a starting geometry has to be supplied in the input file using the $coordinates section. If no optimization is used, the values given here are used for all but the scanned degrees of freedom.

The following options can be set in the $plot section of the input file:

    dof = One or two integers specifying the degrees of freedom that should be plotted. Please note that numbering starts at 0.

    start = One or two float specifying the starting values of the grids in each degree of freedom.

    end = One or two float specifying the end values of the grids in each degree of freedom.

    step = One or two float specifying the step size for the grids in each degree of freedom.

    optimize If given all but the coordinates scanned are optimized, i.e., adjusted to minimize the energy.

    internal If given, internal coordinates that differ from the actual coordinates used in the interface are employed in the plotting. Please note that a transformation from these internal coordinates to the coordinates used in the interface has to be implemented for this to work.

    S = Electronic state to plot. Numbering starts with 0.

    picture = ('adiabatic', 'diabatic') Whether to plot the adiabatic or diabatic (if available) PES. Right now, only diagonal elements can be plotted.
