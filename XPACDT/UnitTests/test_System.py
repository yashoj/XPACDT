#  XPACDT, eXtended PolyAtomic Chemical Dynamics Toolkit
#  XPACDT is a program that can treat polyatomic chemical dynamics problems
#  by solving Newtons equations of motion directly or in an
#  extended ring-polymer phase space. Non-Born-Oppenheimer effects are
#  included employ different approaches, including fewest switches surface
#  hopping.
